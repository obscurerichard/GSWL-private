; This Automated Transaction states:
; "Whenever you encounter the account Expenses:Rent in any transaction, reduce
; the account's amount by $260 and add $260 to the account
; Receivables:Flatmates."
; The rationale behind this is simple. Although the rent is paid by you, your
; flatmates will refund you later on. Thus, you don't really spent all that
; money on rent.

    Expenses:Rent                                $-260
    Receivables:Flatmates                        $260

; This Automated Transaction states:
; "Whenever you encounter the account Expenses:Utilities/Electricity, reduce
; the account's amount by 50% and and increase the account
; Receivables:Flatmates by the same amount."
; Same rationale as above.
= expr account =~ /Expenses:Utilities:Electricity/
    Expenses:Utilities:Electricity               -0.5
    Receivables:Flatmates                         0.5
